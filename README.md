# BlackjackProject

## Overview
### This is an application that can play a hand of black jack with a single player and dealer. It will continue to play hands prompting the played if they want to play agian after every round.  I may even add the concept of multiple decks to add some more depth to the game and make it more casino like. 

## Technologies Used 
* Java
* Eclipse
* Sublime
* Git/GitHub
* MacOS Terminal

## Lessons Learned
### In this project I learned a lot about visibility of classes, methods and fields. It reinforced the concept of good encapculation techniques as well as helped me further wrap my head around O.O.P class structure.  It made me think about emulating program classes around how things are structired in the real world. This has been the most rewarding project yet, as it is actually fun to play.  

### One thing that was missing from my encapsulation was the play hand being a public field. I improved this by making it private abut adding a getter so the app class can call it.
